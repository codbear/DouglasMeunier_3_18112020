# Oh My Food
## OpenClassrooms project | Integrate a website template

I developed this site as part of my training as a Front-End developer on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com).

This is a fictitious mobile first website for menu reservation in restaurants.

As a mobile first product, it works on a large screen, but you would have a better experience on mobile devices.
